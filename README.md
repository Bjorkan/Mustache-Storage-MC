# Mustache Storage

The pack adds a mustache to the single- and double chest. More storage blocks like dispensers may follow, but we will see!

Best used with Faithful 32x installed aswell! **However** this resource pack needs to be placed above Faithful in the resource pack list to be displayed in-game!

## Wait, why? ðŸ¤¨

Well why not? Give Minecraft some personality and show your family and friends your Minecraft chests are fancier than theirs.
